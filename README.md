## APPROACH

First off, I started by coming up with a simple color scheme and whipping up a cool brand logo. Then, I took a good look at the task description and did some digging to figure out the best tech tools to speed up the whole app-making process.

At every turn, like when I added new stuff, I made sure to test things out manually. Gotta be certain everything plays nice together! Once a test went smoothly, I’d jot down a commit and push all those changes to the main branch on GitHub.

Once the whole app was in place, I did a deep dive into the code, tidying it up to make it super clear and easy to understand. Figured it’d be handy for future updates or if we wanted to throw in some new bells and whistles.

After tidying up, I got cracking on writing some basic unit tests.

## MY THOUGHTS

Looking ahead, my priority in future development is doubling down on refining the code further. I intend to implement more sophisticated testing strategies and place a heightened emphasis on elevating the user experience. This involves incorporating smooth transitions between steps and pages, along with enriching animations.

Furthermore, I aim to introduce robust backend functionalities, integrating databases and APIs to amplify the app’s capabilities. This strategic move will significantly enhance its overall performance and utility.
